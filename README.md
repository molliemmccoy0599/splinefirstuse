## Overview

I decided to just play around and build a cute little stack as you can see, there is a bunny and other building block that make up this little design. 

## Users
Me; this was my first time using spline for a solid purpose so it definilty wasn't anything impressive but I feel like the more time I spend with the program the better I will get at it. 

## Learnings
I went with doing something super simple in order to get the basics of the program, I am still pretty uncertain on how to sculp anything super intrecet but I am hopeful that this will change moving forward. The biggest thing is learning about spacial awarness in the program itself I think that is the key.
